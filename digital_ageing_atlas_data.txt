DAA2591	Advanced glycation end products increases in aging human skeletal muscle	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	22	93	Study of young (22-30 years old; mean 25) and old (70-93 years old; mean 78) healthy sedentary individuals showed that the amount of advanced glycation end products increases by ~200% with ageing. In contrast, collagen concentration and pyridinoline cross-links are not significantly changed with aging. Additionally, all general skeletal muscle protein pools are reduced with aging (myofibrillar by 5%, sarcoplasmic by 8%), while the two main contractile proteins, myosin and actin, are not significantly changed. The proportion of MHC I in the muscle increases with aging, whereas MHC IIa and IIx are reduced.	Muscle													3457: Haus, JM et al.

DAA653	Bone becomes more brittle, less flexible	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	An increased porosity resulting from the continuous bone remodelling reduces the structural strength of the bone. The remaining bone becomes more brittle with age via a paradoxically increase in mineralization of the remaining bone tissue. As such, the bone of an elderly person, when subjected to pressure, is more likely to snap and cause a clean fracture which is less likely to heal. In contrast the bone of younger persons is more flexible, because of the higher organic composition of its matrix.	Bone												DAA646,DAA654	2655: Whitbourne, S. K.

Maturation occurring between 12 and 42 weeks of age was characterized with the maintenance of bone mass and mechanical properties. From the peak levels, mice aged for 104 weeks exhibited decreased whole femur mass, percentage of mineralization diminished whole bone stiffness, energy to fracture and decreased cortical thickness.  Periosteal perimeter and, consequently the cross-sectional moments of inertia continued to increase through 104 weeks, compensating for cortical thinning and increased brittleness due to decreased mineralization and stiffness. The shape of the mid-diaphysis became increasingly less elliptical in aged mice. After 52 weeks excessive endocortical resorption appeared, indicating a shift in normal mechanisms regulating bone shape and locating, suggestive of remodelling.

DAA2595	Frequency of somatic mitochondrial mutations increases with age	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	1	99	Using a highly sensitive Duplex Sequencing methodology, the sequencing of mtDNA purified from human brain tissue from both young (<1 year) and old (75-99 years old) individuals showed that the frequency of point mutations increases aproximately 5-fold with age. The mutation spectra for both the young and old samples reveals that the predominant mutations are transition mutations, consistent with either misincorporation by DNA polymerase gamma or deamination of cytosine to form uracil. The relative abundance of each mutation type is the same in young and old. In contrast, G->T mutations (a signature of oxidative damage to DNA), do not significantly increase with age.

DAA736	General increase in action potential firing rates	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	As neurons undergo the process of ageing structural changes occur which would likely affect its synaptic transmissions. In vivo visual corticol neurons of an athestized older-aged monkey there is a increase in action potential (AP) firing rates which is linked to stimulus selectivity degradation. Data has also suggested that there is a rise in AP firing rates in 2/3 layers prefrontal cortical pyrimdal cells in older-aged in comparison those in younger monkeys.
Greater rates of firing in older primate prefrontal cortex could be needed to maintain functions encoded by lower rates in the young prefrontal cortex (reviewed in Dicksten et al., 2007).

DAA2593	Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G molecules changes with age	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	18	93	Analysis of the glycosylation of immunoglobulin G molecules in 5,117 individuals from four European populations, showed that changes in glycan patterns occur with ageing. Strongest association with age was observed for galactosylation: nongalactosylated glycans (A2 and FA2) steadily increased with age, digalactosylated glycans (A2G2, FA2G2, A2BG2, and FA2BG2) decreased with age and monogalactosylated structures (A2G1 FA2G1, A2BG1, and FA2BG1), displayed both increasing and decreasing depending on the position of galactose and the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc. Changes were more dynamic in women, with the most pronounced age associations for women between the ages of 45 and 55 when menopause begins. All other elements of IgG glycosylation (fucosylation, sialylation, and bisecting GlcNAc) also displayed patterns associated with age. In a subsequent longitudinal study, the levels of selected glycans showed similar age-related changes for the same individuals to those observed at the population level.

Acute systemic inflammation induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide endotoxic (LPS) resulted in higher systemic IL-6 levels in older vs. younger mice. Plasma levels increased from 200 to 1200 ng/mL in young vs. old mice and mRNA levels increased 5-fold via Northern blot analysis. Age-associated increases in IL-6 expression were observed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, spleen, and fat, with epididymal adipose tissue exhibiting the greatest IL-6 production. Body temperature of the older mice was also significantly decreased compared to the younger mice 6 hours after administration of LPS, and it seems unclear how much of a contributing factor the decreased fat pad weight in the older mice was to this hypothermia.

DAA2039	K-ATP channels upregulated in human myometrium	physiological	Homo sapiens	female	-1	-1	With age, there is an upregulation of the K-ATP channels in the human myometrium. In the non-pregnant myometrium, ageing causes an upregulation of SUR2B/Kir6.1, subunits forming K ATP channels in this tissue, without affecting the expression of other channel subunits. In the late pregnant myometrium, the level of subunits that do not form functional K ATP channels was not affected by age within the 20â41 age range, in contrast to an uterine upregulation of SUR2B and Kir6.1 in parturient over 35 years. The increase was confirmed by Western blotting.	Myometrium													2854: Du et al. (2013) "KATP channels are up-regulated with increasing age in human myometrium."  Mech.

DAA735	Localized increases and decreases in synaptic transmission	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	In normal ageing processes neurons undergo structural rearrangements. One of these structural rearrangements is a decrease in spine numbers which are the major sites of excitatory synapses which may alter synaptic densities. Studies show that there is an overall decrease in the frequency of spontaneous glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory responses with there also being a reduction in the expression levels of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Ageing also causes significant increases in Î³-aminobutyric acid A receptor-mediated inhibitory responses and action potential firing rates.	Brain													2749: Dickstein et al.

DAA923	Menopause and female fertility loss	physiological	Homo sapiens	male	-1	-1	For the first few years after menarche the menses tends to be irregular. Thereafter and throughout the middle reproductive years, cycles are regular, although they become progressively shorter with advancing age primarily owing to a shortening of follicular phase. In the 2-8 year period preceding the menopause, cycles again become highly variable, ranging from very short to very long. Fertility begins to decline many years prior to onset of irregular menses, being maximum in mid- to late twenties and decreasing steadily until menopause. Age-associated alterations in ovary, neuroendocrine system and uterus may all influence changing pattern of menses as well as declining fertility. The follicle number declines with age.

DAA2597	Mitochondrial DNA content in non-centenerians decreases with age	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	40	70	Study of 961 chinese subjects (424 longevity subjects and 537 younger controls) showed that the mtDNA content for individuals aged 40-70 years old decreases with age. Additionally, no reduction of mtDNA content is observed in nonagenarians and centenarians. Instead, nonagenarians and centenarians show a significant increase in mtDNA content compared to elderly people aged between 50 and 70 years.	Blood													3462: He, YH et al.

DAA2058	Mosaic abnormalities increase	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	45	79	In an analysis of clonal mosaic abnormalities based on 13 genome-wide association studies, the frequency of cancer-free individuals with detectable clonal mosaic events increased with age from 0.23% for those under 50 to 1.91% (P = 4.8 Ã 10â8) for those between the ages of 75 and 79, with slightly higher frequencies occurring in individuals with cancer.
In another study, clonal mosaicism for large chromosomal anomalies (duplications, deletions and uniparental disomy) was found using SNP microarray data from over 50,000 subjects recruited for genome-wide association studies. The frequency of clonal mosaicism in peripheral blood was found to be low (<0.5%) from birth until 50 years of age, after which it rapidly increased to 2-3% in the elderly.

Peak isometric force of the quadriceps is also reduced by 35%, and Peak isometric force normalized to muscle size is reduced by 17%. Similarly, peak power of the quadriceps is reduced by 48%, and peak power normalized to muscle cross sectional area is reduced by 33%. Additionally, stair climb, chair rise, and walk times increase by 45-80%, and stair climbing power is reduced by 40% with aging. Quadriceps maximal shortening velocity reduces by 23%.

In longitudinal studies the loss reaches, at the age of 75, a rate of 0.64â0.70% per year in women and 0.80â00.98% per year in men. At the same time, strength is lost at a rate of 3â4% per year in men and 2.5â3% per year in women, at the age of 75. Studies that assessed changes in mass and strength in the same sample report a loss of strength 2â5 times faster than loss of mass.	Skeletal Muscle												DAA2045	2796: Mitchell et al.

DAA2036	Neural stem cell pool declines	physiological	Mus musculus	male/female	-1	-1	A continuous depletion of the neural stem cell pool was observed with age in the hippocampus. The adult hippocampal stem cells, upon exiting their quiescent state, rapidly undergo a series of asymmetric divisions to produce dividing progeny destined to become neurons and subsequently convert into mature astrocytes. The decrease in the number of neural stem cells is a division-coupled process and is directly related to their production of new neurons. 	Hippocampus													2974: Encinas et al.

DAA721	Neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies in neurons	physiological	Homo sapiens	male	-1	-1	Neurofibrillars tangles and senile plaques are present in the brains of non-demented individuals. In normal ageing, the numbers of tangles, which occupy the cell body of affected neurons is relatively low and restricted to the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Minimal neurofibrillary tangles are present in the transentorhinal region of individuals in middle and late life. The average tangle concentration increases exponentially with age. In contrast, amyloid plaques were absent in some brains up to age 88, and the earliest plaque formation in other cases occurred in the neocortex, in patches of diffuse plaques.

DAA1938	No clear changes in anxiety but decrease in ambulation	psychological	Mus musculus	male/female	-1	-1	There are no clear changes in anxiety with age but there is a decrease in ambulation as measured by the elevated-plus maze. The elevated plus maze is an experimental paradigm used to assess anxiety in rodents. The rodents are placed on a platform with four platform arms, two closed (walled) and two open (unwalled). Rodents normally prefer the closed arms and anxiety increases aversion of the open arms. Greater time spent in the open vs. closed arms, and number of entries onto the open vs. closed arms are thought to reflect reduced anxiety, and the total number of entries onto either platform is used as an index of ambulation (Hogg). With age Fahlstrom et al. found a decrease in ambulation and a significant decrease in the number of entries onto the closed arms. However, no significant trends were observed in time spent in either arm, or in the number of entries into the open arms.

DAA1076	Progressive liquefaction	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	The vitreous humor is a transparent gel of mostly extracellular matrix. With age the gel-like consistency is lost, which is associated with a reduction in shock-absorbing capabilities of the matrix and predisposition to posterior vitreous detachment. Posterior vitreous detachment is a condition where the cortex (outer part) of the vitreous humor detaches from the inner layer of the retina (the inner limiting lamina). Liquefaction is part of a process called synchysis, defined by Stedman's Medical Dictionary as the collapse of the collagenous framework of the vitreous humor with liquefaction of the vitreous body.

No differences in accuracy were observed. Additionally, the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area,  ipsilateral cerebellum, were activated more in the elderly, and the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, putamen (left > right), and contralateral cerebellum were activated in the elderly only.

DAA1981	Selective increase in oxidative damage and decrease in antioxidant function during aging in the substantia nigra	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	A significant increase in protein oxidation, loss of mitochondrial complex I activity and increased astrocytic proliferation were observed with increasing age in the substantia nigra. This was attributed to a significant decrease in antioxidant function represented by superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (GPx) and GSH reductase (GR) and a decreasing trend in total GSH and catalase with increasing age. All these parameters were found to be relatively unaltered in the caudate nucleus.

DAA2053	Sweating capacity decreases	physiological	Homo sapiens	male/female	-1	-1	Local sweating capacity is lower in older subjects (measured as a response of sweat glands to pharmacological stimuli). Although in most cases it seems that the sweat output declines continuously throughout adulthood, there are also studies suggesting that the glandular function declines after 60-70 years old. Additionally, regional differences in sweat gland function have been observed, with a greater age effect on the forehead and limbs than on the trunk. 
Studies also suggest that during passive heat exposure older men and women sweat less than younger people. It is still debatable whether this change is determined by ageing, or if it is only strongly correlated with VO2 max. 	Sweat Gland													2652: Drinkwater et al.

Nonetheless, an age-dependent decline in telomerase activity and telomere length was not significant in one study by Wagner et al. There was also a tendency for an increasing interpersonal heterogeneity of telomere length with age. CD34+CD38 stem cells purified from adult bone marrow have shorter telomeres than cells from fetal liver or umbilical cord blood.	Hematopoietic Stem Cells		Cellular											2681: Oeseburg et al.
